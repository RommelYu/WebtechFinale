Expression Language
 JSP technology version 2.0 supports expression language(EL). EL makes it easy to easily access data application that is stored
in JavaBeans components. e.g ${name} <- this expression allows an access on a bean using simple syntax.
JSTL TAGS
<c:out>
 -it is similar to a JSP expression tag
 - c:out can be used only with expression.
 -displays the result of an expression similar to <%=...%> work.
	e.g <c:out value="${'Example1'}">
<c:import>
 -just like the JSP 'include'.
 -can include the content of any source wether it's in the server or outside the server.
 - provides all the functionality of the include action.
 e.g
 <c:import var="data" url="http://www.google.com"/>

<c:set>
 -<c:set> is used to set the result of an expression that is evaluated in a scope.
 -Similar to jsp:setProperty action tag in JSP.
 -e.g <c:set var="Income" scope="session" value="${4000*4}"/>

SERVER SIDE WEB SCRIPTING

JAVA SERVLETS
- Java object that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications
- handles client requests by generating responses to such requests
- part of the Java EE specification
- hosted in a 'servlet container' that provides the environment  in which the servlet runs, as well as 
controls the servlet life cylcle.

SERVLET LIFECYCLE:
instantiation = constructor call
	- creates an instance of the servlet to service client requests
	- invoked implicity by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service a client
	request and no instance currently exists.

initialization = init() method..
	- invoked only onceand is intended for any start up initialization code for the servlet.

request handling = service() method..
	- invoked for each client request..
	- servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate response
	- multiple client requests are typically handled by a to ensure that the code being run by the servlet is 
	'thread-safe'

destruction = destroy() method..
	- invoked before the servlet instance is 'unloaded'

HTTP SERVLET
- java servlet used to handle HTTP request and generate HTTP responses
- hosted in a 'web container' which is a component in a java 'application server' (e.g. Apache Tomcat, Redhat)
- the service() method call is routed to a doxxx() call, depending on the HTTP request method, e.g. doGet(),
doPost(), doHead(),doDelete()

HTTP SERVLET REQUEST:
- object representation of the HTTP request sent by the client and received by the servlet

HTTP SERVLET RESPONSE:
- object presentation of the HTTP responses, generated by the servlet and sent back to the requesting client.
- used to set information in the response message.

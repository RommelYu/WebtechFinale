AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files. AJAX’s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page.
The two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following:
- Make requests to the server without reloading the page
- Receive and work with data from the server

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.
Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the sever using synchronous requests. It means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server.
With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.
XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used.
AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.

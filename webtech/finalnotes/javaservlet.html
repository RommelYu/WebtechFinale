	<h2>What is a Java Servlet?</h2>
	<p>
	Java Servlet is a java object that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications. It handles client request by generating responses to such request. Servlets provide a component-based, platform-independent method for building Web based applications, without the performance limitations of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs. Java Servlet is part of the Java EE specification and hosted in a 'servlet container' that provides the environment  in which the servlet runs, as well as controls the servlet life cycle.

	<h3>Servlet Lifecycle</h3>
	<ul> A servlet lifecycle can be defined as the entire process from its creation till the destruction. The following are the paths followed by a servlet. <br><br>
	<li>The servlet is initialized by calling the init() method.</li>
	<li>The servlet calls service() method to process a client's request.</li>
	<li>The servlet is terminated by calling the destroy() method.</li>
	<li>Finally, servlet is garbage collected by the garbage collector of the JVM.</li>
	</ul>	
	<b>1)INSTALLATION => constructor call </b> - Created an instance of the servlet to service client request. <br> Invoked implicitly by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service a client request and no instance currently exist.
<br><br>
	<b>2)INITIALIZATION => service() method</b> - invoked only once and is intended for any start up initialization code for the servlet. <br>
		Servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate a response. <br>
		The service() method checks the HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and calls doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate. <br>
		Multiple client request are typically handled by a single, multi-threaded servlet instance.
<br><br>
	<b>3)Request Handling = service() method</b> Invoked for each client request. <br>
		Servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate response <br>
		Multiple client requests are typically handled by a to ensure that the code being run by the servlet is ‘thread-safe’.
<br><br>
		<b>4)Destruction => destroy() method</b> Invoked before the servlet instance is ‘unloaded’.  <br>
		The destroy() method is called only once at the end of the life cycle of a servlet.

	<h3>Classes of "javax.servlet"</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>GenericServlet - Defines a generic, protocol-independent servlet.</li>
	<li>ServletInputStream - Provides an input stream for reading binary data from a client request, including an efficient readLine method for reading data one line at a time.</li>
	<li>ServletOutputStream - Provides an output stream for sending binary data to the client.</li>
	<li>ServletRequestWrapper - Provides a convenient implementation of the ServletRequest interface that can be subclassed by developers wishing to adapt the request to a Servlet.</li>
	<li>ServletResponseWrapper - Provides a convenient implementation of the ServletResponse interface that can be subclassed by developers wishing to adapt the response from a Servlet.</li>
	<li>ServletRequestEvent - Events of this kind indicate lifecycle events for a ServletRequest.</li>
	<li>ServletContextEvent - This is the event class for notifications about changes to the servlet context of a web application.</li>
	<li>ServletRequestAttributeEvent - This is the event class for notifications of changes to the attributes of the servlet request in an application.</li>
	<li>ServletContextAttributeEvent - This is the event class for notifications about changes to the attributes of the servlet context of a web application.</li>
	<li>ServletException - Defines a general exception a servlet can throw when it encounters difficulty.</li>
	<li>UnavailableException - Defines an exception that a servlet or filter throws to indicate that it is permanently or temporarily unavailable.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Interfaces of "javax.servlet.http"</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>HttpServletRequest - Extends the ServletRequest interface to provide request information for HTTP servlets.</li>
	<li>HttpServletResponse - Extends the ServletResponse interface to provide HTTP-specific functionality in sending a response.</li>
	<li>HttpSession - Provides a way to identify a user across more than one page request or visit to a Web site and to store information about that user.</li>
	<li>HttpSessionListener - Implementations of this interface are notified of changes to the list of active sessions in a web application.</li>
	<li>HttpSessionAttributeListener - This listener interface can be implemented in order to get notifications of changes to the attribute lists of sessions within this web application.</li>
	<li>HttpSessionBindingListener - Causes an object to be notified when it is bound to or unbound from a session.</li>
	<li>HttpSessionActivationListener - Objects that are bound to a session may listen to container events notifying them that sessions will be passivated and that session will be activated.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Classes of "javax.servlet.http"</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>HttpServlet - Provides an abstract class to be subclassed to create an HTTP servlet suitable for a Web site.</li>
	<li>Cookie - Creates a cookie, a small amount of information sent by a servlet to a Web browser, saved by the browser, and later sent back to the server.</li>
	<li>HttpServletRequestWrapper - Provides a convenient implementation of the HttpServletRequest interface that can be subclassed by developers wishing to adapt the request to a Servlet.</li>
	<li>HttpServletResponseWrapper - Provides a convenient implementation of the HttpServletResponse interface that can be subclassed by developers wishing to adapt the response from a Servlet.</li>
	<li>HttpSessionEvent - This is the class representing event notifications for changes to sessions within a web application.</li>
	<li>HttpSessionBindingEvent - Events of this type are either sent to an object that implements HttpSessionBindingListener when it is bound or unbound from a session,
	or to a HttpSessionAttributeListener that has been configured in the deployment descriptor when any attribute is bound, unbound or replaced in a session.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What is a Java Servlet?</h2>
	<p>
	Java Servlet is a java object that are intended to play the role of server components in client-server communications. It handles client request by generating responses to such request. Servlets provide a component-based, platform-independent method for building Web based applications, without the performance limitations of <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr> programs. Java Servlet is part of the Java EE specification and hosted in a "servlet container" that provides the environment  in which the servlet runs, as well as controls the servlet life cycle.

	<h3>Servlet Lifecycle</h3>
	<ul> A servlet lifecycle can be defined as the entire process from its creation till the destruction. The following are the paths followed by a servlet. <br><br>
	<li>The servlet is initialized by calling the init() method.</li>
	<li>The servlet calls service() method to process a client's request.</li>
	<li>The servlet is terminated by calling the destroy() method.</li>
	<li>Finally, servlet is garbage collected by the garbage collector of the JVM.</li>
	</ul>	
	<b>1) INSTALLATION => constructor call </b> - Created an instance of the servlet to service client request. <br> Invoked implicitly by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service a client request and no instance currently exist. <br><br>
	<b>2) INITIALIZATION => service() method</b> - invoked only once and is intended for any start up initialization code for the servlet. <br>
		Servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate a response. <br>
		The service() method checks the HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and calls doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate. <br>
		Multiple client request are typically handled by a single, multi-threaded servlet instance. <br><br>
	<b>3) Request Handling = service() method</b> Invoked for each client request. <br>
		Servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate response <br>
		Multiple client requests are typically handled by a to ensure that the code being run by the servlet is "thread-safe". <br><br>
	<b>4) Destruction => destroy() method</b> Invoked before the servlet instance is ‘unloaded’.  <br>
		The destroy() method is called only once at the end of the life cycle of a servlet. <br><br>

		<h2>What is <abbr title="JavaServer Pages">JSP</abbr></h2>
		<p>Java Server Pages (JSP) is a server-side programming technology that enables the creation of dynamic, platform-independent method for building Web-based applications. JSP have access to the entire family of Java <abbr title="Application Program Interface(s)">APIs</abbr>, including the Java <abbr title="Java Database Connectivity">JDBC</abbr>API to access enterprise databases. JSP technology separates the user interface from content generation, enabling designers to change the overall page layout without altering the underlying dynamic content.</p>
		<p> JavaServer Pages technology is an extension of the Java Servlet technology. Servlets are platform-independent, server-side modules that fit seamlessly into a Web server framework and can be used to extend the capabilities of a Web server with minimal overhead, maintenance, and support. JSP technology and servlets provide an attractive alternative to other types of dynamic Web scripting/programming by offering: platform independence; enhanced performance; separation of logic from display; ease of administration; extensibility into the enterprise; and, most importantly, ease of use.</p>

	<h3>JSP Lifecycle</h3>
	<ul> A JSP life cycle is defined as the process from its creation till the destruction. This is similar to a servlet life cycle with an additional step which is required to compile a JSP into servlet.<br><br>
		<img src="IMG/jsplc.jpg" width="250"> <br>
	<b>1) JSP Compilation</b> - The compilation process involves three steps; Parsing the JSP, Turning the JSP into a servlet, Compiling the servlet.
<br><br>
	<b>2) JSP Initialization</b> - When a container loads a JSP it invokes the jspInit() method before servicing any requests.
<br><br>
	<b>3) JSP Execution</b> -  It represents all interactions with requests until the JSP is destroyed.<br>
		The _jspService() method of a JSP is invoked on request basis.
<br><br>
		<b>4) JSP Cleanup</b> -  It represents when a JSP is being removed from use by a container.  <br>
		The jspDestroy() method is the JSP equivalent of the destroy method for servlets. 
<br><br>
</ul>

	<h3>JSP Tag Library</h3>
	<ul> JSTL has support for common, structural tasks such as iteration and conditionals, tags for manipulating XML documents, internationalization tags, and SQL tags. It also provides a framework for integrating the existing custom tags with the JSTL tags.<br><br>
	<b>Core Tags</b> - The core group of tags are the most commonly used JSTL tags. <br><br>
	 			1. <b>c:out</b> - This tag can be used only with expression and displays the result of an expression similar to <%=...%> work.
		<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/tag1.JPG" width="250"> </h5>
		<br>
			2.  <b>c:import</b> - This tag can include the content of any source wether it's in the server or outside the server and provides all the functionality of the include action.
		<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/tag2.JPG" width="350"> </h5>
		<br>
			3.  <b>c:set </b>-This tag is used to set the result of an expression that is evaluated in a scope.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/tag3.JPG" width="370"> </h5>
		<br>
			4.  <b>c:remove</b> - This tag is used for removing a variable in a scope tag. It either remove a specified scope or the first scope.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/tag4.JPG" width="200"> </h5>
		<br><br>
	
	<b>Formatting Tags</b> - The JSTL formatting tags are used to format and display text, the date, the time, and numbers for internationalized Website <br><br>		
			1.	 <b>fmt:setTimeZone</b>	- It stores the time zone inside a time zone configuration variable.
		<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/for1.JPG" width="450"> </h5>
		<br>
			2.  <b>fmt:setBundle</b> - It loads the resource bundle and stores it in a bundle configuration variable or the named scoped variable.
		<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/for2.JPG" width="450"> </h5>
		<br>
			3.  <b>fmt:message </b>- It display an internationalized message.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/for3.JPG" width="450"> </h5>
		<br>
			4.  <b>fmt:formatDate</b> - It formats the time and/or date using the supplied pattern and styles.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/for4.JPG" width="450"> </h5>
		<br>
			5.  <b>fmt:parseNumber </b>- It is used to Parses the string representation of a currency, percentage or number.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/for5.JPG" width="450"> </h5>
		<br>
			6.  <b>fmt:timeZone</b> - It specifies a parsing action nested in its body or the time zone for any time formatting.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/for6.JPG" width="450"> </h5>
		<br><br>
		
<b> <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> Tags</b> - The JSTL XML tags are used for providing a JSP - centric way of manipulating and creating XML documents. <br><br>	
			1.  <b>x:out </b>-  This tag is used for displaying the result of an xml Path expression and writes the result to JSP writer object. It is similar to the scriptlet tag <%= %> used in JSP.
		<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/xml1.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br>
			2.  <b>x:if </b>- This tag is used for evaluating the test XPath expression. It is a simple conditional tag which is used for evaluating its body if the supplied condition is true.
		<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/xml2.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br>
			3.  <b>x:transform </b>- This tag is used in a XML document for providing the <abbr title="Extensible Stylesheet Language">XSL</abbr> transformation. It is used for transforming xml data based on XSLT script.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/xml3.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br>
			4.  <b>x:param </b>- This tag is used to set the parameter in the XSLT style sheet. It use along with the transform tag for sending parameter along with the value.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/xml4.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br>
			5.  <b>x:choose -</b> This tag is a conditional tag that establish a context for mutually exclusive conditional operations
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/xml5.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br><br>
		
		
		<b> <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> Tags</b> - The SQL tag library allows the tag to interact with <abbr title="Relational Databases Management System(s)">RDBMSs</abbr> such as Microsoft SQL Server, mySQL, or Oracle.<br><br>	
			1.  <b>sql:setDataSource </b> - It is used for creating a simple data source suitable only for prototyping.
		<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/sql1.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br>
			2.  <b>sql:query</b> - It is used for executing the SQL query defined in its sql attribute or the body.
		<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/sql2.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br>
			3.  <b>sql:update </b>- It is used for executing the SQL update defined in its sql attribute or in the tag body.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/sql3.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br>
			4.  <b>sql:dateParam </b>- It is used for sets the parameter in an SQL statement to a specified java.util.Date value.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/sql4.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
		<br>
		5.  <b>sql:transaction </b>- It is used to provide the nested database action with a common connection.
			<h5> Example: <img src="IMG/sql5.JPG" width="400"> </h5>
